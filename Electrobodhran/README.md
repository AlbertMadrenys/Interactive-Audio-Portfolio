#Electrobodhrán
The bodhrán is a drum commonly played in traditional Irish music. It is typically made of goatskin,
with a frame that usually ranges from 35 to 45 cm in diameter. As a one-sided drum, the bodhrán
is placed vertically on the player’s leg. One hand strikes the skin side with a beater, while the other
hand touches the back of the skin through the open side of the instrument to control the pitch and
timbre. By capturing the vibrations of the skin, the original sound can be enhanced using digital signal
processing. This can be done by attaching a piezoelectric sensor to the skin with vinyl tape.
