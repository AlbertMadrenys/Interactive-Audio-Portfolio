# Interactive Audio Portfolio
This portfolio showcases the possibilities at the intersection of human interaction and sound
technology, encouraging new avenues of expression and innovation.

It comprises three projects: Electrobodhrán, Connect 4ton, and SuperOSCollider, each one focusing on different elements.

## Electrobodhrán
The bodhrán is a drum commonly played in traditional Irish music. It is typically made of goatskin,
with a frame that usually ranges from 35 to 45 cm in diameter. As a one-sided drum, the bodhrán
is placed vertically on the player’s leg. One hand strikes the skin side with a beater, while the other
hand touches the back of the skin through the open side of the instrument to control the pitch and
timbre. By capturing the vibrations of the skin, the original sound can be enhanced using digital signal
processing. This can be done by attaching a piezoelectric sensor to the skin with vinyl tape.

## Connect 4ton
Connect 4 is a classic tabletop game where two players choose a color and take turns dropping colored
tokens into a suspended grid. It is a highly popular and well-known game, easily accessible for anyone
to pick up and strategize. Because of its familiarity, it is an ideal candidate for adding a unique twist.
Introducing an audio interactive system that responds to the evolving match could offer an interesting
and enjoyable experience. Light will be used to manipulate the sound.

* Adaptive music
* Electronic components
* Csound
* Arduino
* MIDI

## SuperOSCollider
SuperOSCollider is a demonstration of the capabilities of SuperCollider, OSC messages, and the use
of AI processing to modify musical elements. This demo is not intended to be artistic but will focus
more on the technology and structural principles of designing a complex system. This system will
includes different processes communicating with each other using OSC messages. As a result, the
audio design will be kept simple to make it easier to detect and understand what is happening behind
the scenes.

* SuperCollider
* OSC
* Wekinator AI
* Xbox 360 controller
* Face detection
