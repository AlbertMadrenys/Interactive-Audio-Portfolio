# Connect 4ton
Connect 4 is a classic tabletop game where two players choose a color and take turns dropping colored
tokens into a suspended grid. It is a highly popular and well-known game, easily accessible for anyone
to pick up and strategize. Because of its familiarity, it is an ideal candidate for adding a unique twist.
Introducing an audio interactive system that responds to the evolving match could offer an interesting
and enjoyable experience. Light will be used to manipulate the sound.
